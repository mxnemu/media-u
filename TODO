Roadmap:
-When status == waiting for new episodes add an NyaaRssListener to the show
-listen to nyaa rss feeds download torrents with `curl '(url)' --compressed`
-add new episodes to transmission-cli
-choose fansubber Ui on TVShowPage
-list subtitleTracks & audiotrack names

Optional:
-generate thumbnails for each episode
-try konachan and yande.re before getting pics from gelbooru

Probably won't fix:
-make mplayer use the gpu of the raspberry pi
 alternative: fix omxplayers playbackerrors and horrific subtitles
 alternative: just import stuff and export symlinks with xbmc compatible names
-any raspberry pi support

Bugs:
-Some remaining false-positive results from MAL search, get better query compare
-some strings form MAL are not properly decoded with QUrl::fromPercentEncoding
